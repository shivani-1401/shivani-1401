My name is Shivani Agrawal and I am a Software Engineer at Natwest Group. I graduated from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore in 2020 with a Bachelor of Technology focused in Electronics and Communication Engineering with Specialization in Internet of Things and Sensors.

- 🤔 I’m looking for motivation to start writing blog and also to include Yoga🧘 in my daily routine.
- 💬 Ask me about anything: Love coffee☕ as much as I do? Let's talk about how awesome they're! We can code while we have coffee.    
- ⚡ Fun fact: I ❤️ DairyMilk a lot. It's my biggest weakness.🙈
